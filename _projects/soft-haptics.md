The first phase of my PhD research involves the development of a novel vibrotactile interface. This project, started during my PhD and expanding rapidly since, uses the principle of particle jamming to affect the softness of a tactile display, as well as serving as a basis for creating multimodal haptic devices which incorporate other sensations such as vibration, shape and temperature.

## Research Aims
- To investigate how softness change can be used in a variety of haptic interactions
- To particle jamming as a foundation for low-cost, highly portable soft haptic devices
- To investigate the combination of softness and other tactile sensations, u
- To investigate the physical propagation of vibrations through a granular fluids of controllable viscosity

## Particle Jamming
Particle jamming is an emergent technology in soft robotics where the particles that make up a granular fluid are compacted such that each particle is braced against its adjacent particles. Jammed fluids are, by definition, stiffer and harder than the same material in an unjammed state, and this leads to many changes in their properties, such as increased viscosity and stiffness. {% cite Brown2024_nonpneumatic_jamming%}

## Adding Vibration

## Characterisation
A prototype for a novel haptic device based on the particle jamming effect described above was completed in early 2019 (photo at the top of the page) and very kindly funded by the IEEE Technical Committee on Haptics. The initial prototype consists of a rigid case filled with small particles, covered by a silicone touch pad. This mechanical device can be connected to an electronic vacuum regulator to control the strength of the jamming effect. This device uses a simple vacuum pump to generate an area of low pressure inside the case, forcing the soft cover into the device and causing the particles to jam. An ERM type vibrating motor is loosly suspended in the fluid to provide vibrations which are then restricted by the jamming of the particles. {% cite Brown2020_Soft_Haptic_Interface_Based_On_Vibration %}
