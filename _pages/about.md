I'm an Independent Research Fellow in the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery at Imperial College London where I work at the intersection of robotics, human-computer interaction and medicine. My primary research interest is in haptics though my past research has covered topics including digital manufacturing, personalised medical devices, robotics for muscular rehabilitation and information visualisation. I am currently working on haptic simulations of physical medical examinations which will be deployed to support Imperial's MBBS in Medicine curriculum.

I first joined Imperial as an undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2014, before returning as a researcher in Bioengineering in 2020 and Research Associate (postdoc) with the Department of Surgery and Cancer as part of the Centre for Engagement and Simulation Science and SiMMS research group. I am currently a Research Fellow in the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery. I completed my PhD in Haptics at Queen Mary University of London and have been a visiting researcher at York University in Canada and Seoul National University in South Korea. I currently hold a Visiting Scholar appointment in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, am a member of the London Institute for Healthcare Engineering, and am Chief Engineer and co-founder of Human Robotix Ltd.
