I enjoyed presenting my recent work on particle jamming-based soft haptics at the EuroHaptics 2024 workshop on [Haptic Intelligence Embodied in Artificial Soft Systems](https://www.tdaunizeau.com/workshops/eh2024/home/). Huge thanks to MichaÃ«l Wiertlewski and Thomas Daunizeau for the invitation. Check out the [video recording](https://youtu.be/2DWNzQPqhn8?si=29uYsW1UvxidHvyV)!
