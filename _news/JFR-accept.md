I'm thrilled to see my article on using a soft haptic touchpad to teleoperate ROVs accepted for publication in the Journal of Field Robotics! Huge thank you to Prof. Michael Jenkin, who supported and hosted the study in the Vision, Graphics and Robotics Lab at York University in Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Watch this space for the open-access paper!
