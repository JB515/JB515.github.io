I was surprised and honored to recieve an Honorable Mention for the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Haptics Symposium in Long Beach, California for my work on mechanical approaches to actuating particle jamming-based tactile displays. Thanks to my co-author, Prof Fernando Bello and the IET and Brain charity for funding my attendance!
